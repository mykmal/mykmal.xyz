# Mykhaylo's personal website

This is the repository for my personal website, which you should visit at <https://mykmal.xyz>.

For those who want to know the details:

- I write all website content in Markdown and save configuration settings in TOML format. That's what you will find in this repository.
- The Markdown and TOML files are compiled into HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator.
- Whenever I push a commit, the site is automatically recompiled by ([Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and then deployed on Netlify's content delivery network (CDN).
- My site is based on the [Congo theme](https://github.com/jpanther/congo) for Hugo, which provides fully responsive layouts built with Tailwind CSS. Congo is installed on my site as a Hugo module.
